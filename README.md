<!-- # This is just a framework! -->

Information included in Standards Onboard is the product of experience and research.

These are *basic* best practices and new hire steps from various sources around the internet. There are many, many ways to develop, and I personally don't believe there is one best way for everyone.

Included here are *general* guides drawn from what the small teams I have been on either had or didn't have.

**If you disagree, that's fine! Please check out the [contributing.md](contributing.md) doc to help out.**
