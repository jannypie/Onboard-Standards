# Onboarding Team Members

Onboarding is not just a necessary evil for new hires and their teams: according to Gallup, it's an important step in acquiring and retaining talent.

## Before Hiring

1. Plan in advance a general agenda for new employees' first week to avoid confusion, awkwardness, and wasted time for everyone
  - Partnering time with team members &amp; mentors throughout week
  - Completing new employee training
  - Completing paperwork
- Fill out the [Convenient References Sheet](convenient-sheet.md)
- Create a [People Cheat Sheet](people-cheat-sheet.md)
  - people on your team, what they do, and how to contact them
  - people who frequently work with your team
- Create an [Org Cheat Sheet](org-cheat-sheet.md) - how your department fits into the company as a whole
- Gather documentation on codebase to provide an informational overview
- Identify company required training
  - Have materials collected
  - Know about how much time each training session lasts


## Before First Day

1. Reserve a work station, desk, or cubicle
  - Provide paper and writing utensils for first-day notes
2. Get set up with IT
  - Employee email account activated
    - Invitation to Slack channel (or other team communication tools)
  - Computers should have
    - login account
    - required programs installed
    - working connection to printers
    - working connection to email

  - Dedicated phone &amp; extension
3. Contact employee to soothe first-day jitters
  - Who to contact upon arrival
  - Parking instructions
  - Directions to office
  - Common lunch spots nearby

It's nice to have a welcome gift of some sort, although not required

- Examples:
  - Branded company material
  - Bottle of water
  - Coffee mug

## First Week

1. Give a casual, *not rushed*, tour of the office
2. Schedule a block of time for necessary paperwork and company training
3. Schedule time with immediate manager
  - get to know each other
  - talk about the team and project work in the near term
  - talk about management styles and work environment accommodations
4. Follow the First Week Agenda your team created

It's nice to have current employees offer to take new teammate out for lunch, but not required. Let your new staffer decide based on their comfort level rather than scheduling it.
