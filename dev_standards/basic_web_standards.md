# General Code Standards

In code, there are many ways to do any number of things. It is better to choose a standard for your team and be consistent to that standard, than to change your processes everytime a new article comes out.

> BE CONSISTENT. If you're editing code, take a few minutes to look at the code around you and determine its style. If they use spaces around all their arithmetic operators, you should too. If their comments have little boxes of hash marks around them, make your comments have little boxes of hash marks around them too.

> The point of having style guidelines is to have a common vocabulary of coding so people can concentrate on what you're saying rather than on how you're saying it.

That said, it's also important to practice good code standards which may update over time. Standards included here should be reviewed and corrected periodically.
